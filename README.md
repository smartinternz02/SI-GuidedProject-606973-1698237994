# GPU Share Price Estimation Website

## Overview
The GPU Share Price Estimation website is a comprehensive platform designed for individuals interested in predicting and understanding the 
share prices of the top 5 GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) companies in the market. Leveraging the power of machine learning, 
this project offers users a unique and user-friendly experience, combining technology, data analytics, 
and financial insights to empower informed decision-making in the dynamic world of GPU markets.

## Key Features
1. **Share Price Prediction**
   - **Prediction Form:** Users can utilize an intuitive and user-friendly prediction form to input key parameters such as low, high, volume, and more for a personalized and accurate share price estimation.
   
2. **About Us**
   - **Team Expertise:** Learn about the passionate team behind the project, led by Aayushi Singh Thakur and Rishika Sahoo. The team brings together a unique combination of expertise in finance and machine learning to provide accurate and insightful predictions.

3. **Contact Information**
   - **Direct Communication:** Users have direct access to contact information, such as mail addresses, making it easy to reach out for inquiries, collaborations, or additional support.

## How It Works
1. **Prediction Input:** Users navigate to the prediction form, where they input relevant parameters, including low, high, volume, and more.
2. **Machine Learning Model:** The backend, powered by a machine learning model stored in the `model.pkl` file, processes the user input to generate accurate share price predictions.
3. **Output Display:** The prediction results are dynamically displayed on the website, providing users with valuable insights into the estimated share prices of the top GPU companies.

## Project Structure
- **templates:** The `templates` directory contains HTML files that structure different sections of the website, ensuring a modular and organized design.
- **static:** This directory holds the styles (CSS) and interactivity (JS) components, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **model.pkl:** The `model.pkl` file houses the machine learning model, meticulously trained to predict GPU share prices with accuracy.
- **app.py:** The `app.py` file serves as the backend, handling user inputs and seamlessly serving the web application through Flask.
